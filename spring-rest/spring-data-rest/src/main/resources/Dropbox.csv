1ae51919-9e60-47b9-8a9f-3ad552648f5f,storage will not lower when you delete a bunch of stuff bc it is now all about them making you buy storage! RIDICULOUS!,1
7c80ebde-3d32-44ae-a689-4fd6340355b5,"Utterly useless. Refuses to upload even a single image, or takes an hour to do so after telling me I'm not connected to a network, which is false. I've switched back to using the dropbox website on both mobile and desktop with no problems. I've been using Dropbox app on mobile and desktop and it's honestly never been worse. I just bought a faster cable to hardwire my phone to my desktop to transfer files. What a better option ðŸ¤ª",1

After consulting community posts, I turned off ""Grammerly"" text correction for the app and hope that works.",3

4af2cfb3-4569-4ffd-9cc0-21620c468b92,I HATE this app. I have a photography business and it now takes me almost an hour to upload 30 photos. And it frequently freezes up altogether. It's like I need to buy a 2nd computer just for uploading photos to garbage dropbox because it ties up the computer for so long.I have the most expensive subscription and the fastest internet available. It makes my normal work day much more difficult. The only part of my work day I don't like is dealing with dropbox.,1
